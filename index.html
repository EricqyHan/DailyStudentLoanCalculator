      <h2>How to calculate student loan interest</h2>
      <p>To see how to calculate student loan interest in practice, get out your pen and paper and follow along using
         the
         following example. Not a math person? Our student loan interest calculator below does the calculation for
         you.
      </p>
      <p>For this example, say you borrow $10,000 at a 7% annual interest rate. On a 10-year standard repayment plan,
         your
         monthly payment would be about $116.</p>

   <section class="questionOne">
      <p><strong>1. Calculate your daily interest rate (sometimes called interest rate factor). </strong> Divide your
         annual studen loan interest rate by the number of days in the year.</p>
      <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
      <p class="example">.07/365 = 0.00019, or 0.019%</p>
      <p>Your Daily Interest Rate Calculated</p>
      <p><span class="interestRateHundredths">.00</span>/365 = <span
            class="dailyinterestRateTenThousandths">0.00000</span>, or <span
            class="dailyinterestRateHundredths">0.000</span>%
      </p>

   </section>

   <section class="questionTwo">
      <p><strong>2. Calculate the amount of interest your loan accrues per day.</strong> Multiply your outstanding loan
         balance by your daily interest rate.</p>
      <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
      <p class="example">$10,000 x 0.00019 = $1.90
      </p>
      <p>Amount of interest YOU accure per day</p>
      <p>$<span class="amountBorrowed">0</span> x <span class="dailyinterestRateTenThousandths">0.00000</span> = $ <span
            class="amountPerDay">0.00</span></p>
   </section>

   <section class="questionThree">
      <p><strong>3. Find your monthly interest payment.</strong> Multiply your daily interest amount by the number of
         days
         since your last payment.</p>
      <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
      <p class="example">$1.90 x 30 = $57</p>
      <p>Your Monthly Interest</p>
      <p>$<span class="amountPerDay">0.00</span> x 30 = $<span class="dailyCalculation">0.00</span></p>
